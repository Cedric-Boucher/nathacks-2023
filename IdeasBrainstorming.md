## Our Ideas an our BrainStorming process

We were very inspired by the presentation from the Alzheimer's society so we started our brain storming process around helping someone with Alzheimer's.

### Hardware available:
 - Muse 2
 - Computers

### Cognitive Training (Alzheimer's Based Idea)

Using the Muse 2 we would track brain activity of the user during some kind of test, we could make the test easier or harder depending on the users level of engagement or difficulty experienced.

#### Why we didn't choose this:

We don't know enough about Alzheimer's and we don't have access to a patient to test


### Memory Enhancement Using Music (Alzheimer's Based Idea)

We know that Alzheimer's patients can respond positively to music, we wanted to see if we could measure the brain activity around listening to certain music.

#### Why we didn't choose this:

We don't know enough about Alzheimer's and we don't have access to a patient to test

### Brain Signals to Virtual Xbox Controller

Turing the brain signals into a xbox controller would allow for those with debilitating disabilities to use computer, complete tasks, and overall make they're lives easier. 

#### Why we didn't choose this:

Using the Muse 2 we only have 4 channels, thus limiting greatly what we can measure. With the Muse 2 we can only really measure levels of focus.

### Emotion Tracking Emergency Alert

Using a brain interface device we would measure emotions of someone, potentially someone with a emotional based mental illness. We could alert someone if the user is having a mental health crisis like a panic attack.

#### Why we didn't choose this:

Using the Muse 2 we only have 4 channels, thus limiting greatly what we can measure. With the Muse 2 we can only really measure levels of focus. Levels of emotions would require a lot more channels.


### Emergency Detector and Alert

From the last idea, but using more sensors from the Muse 2. The Muse 2 has many other sensors, such as Gyro, pulse, and blood oxygen. Adding onto the last idea, we could now potentially alert someone if the user fell, or if they we're having some kind of other emergency. We looked into the research around detecting stokes. 

#### Why we didn't choose this:

This idea only really used brain activity when predicting strokes, so maybe a just a stroke detector would be better.

### Pomodoro Plus

The classic 40:20 study break ratio, but with a twist. We will look at the users brain activity to determine the length of the next study break session.

#### Why we choose this idea:

We choose this idea because of many things. We could probably use the hardware we had to actually implement this, the Muse 2 has enough channels to accurately determine focus. This project has enough complexity to keep us all busy; getting the data from the Muse 2, processing the data, determining the length of the next session, and of course the app that the user interacts with. These are the main reasons we choose this idea.

### Emotionally Intelligent Chatbot (using chat gpt)

Using a LLM like chat gpt we could measure the users emotions and inform the chatbot the emotions of the user.

#### Why we didn't choose this:

We thought of the questionable ethics of this idea.

### Meeting Productivity

Alert boss if you are not focusing (this was a bit of a joke), therefor we choose not to develop if further.

### Duolingo type idea

Using the Muse 2 data we determine if the user is effectively learning a language, we could adjust the difficulty of the lesson based on if the user is "learning".

#### Why we didn't choose this:

We choose not to do this because apps like Dualingo already know if learning is effective from the trial and error of the user.
